Support Bracket for Light Sensor

Notes for this project have been kept at <http://members.shaw.ca/danielpeirce/notes/photometer_richmond/photometer.html>.

## write.scad support file

Made use of Write.scad from another project. Required files can be obtained at <http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16193>
Note that write.scad requires letters.dxf.

Both of those files should be put in same directory as support-astr1100-half.scad to compile that file without error.
